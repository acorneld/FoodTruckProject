                    [Lessons Learned]
                  Chapter 1 : Spaghetti Code Chronicles

UML is extremely useful and could have probably saved me tons of time.
I tried to hold most of the information in my head and it resulted in a
"Spaghetti hole" where I ended up adding all kinds of things I didn't need instead
of fixing a simple mistake present all along.  Fellow future developers were able
to aid me in both seeing where a small error was made (shoutout to: Austin BreckenFelder),
and others were able to point me towards lessons from the week I had not yet referenced
(Shoutout to Lucas Paladini for being around all weekend to helpout).

Really I learned that putting more time into something isn't always the answer and
that taking time to decompress and clear my head is all but essential in this line
of work.
